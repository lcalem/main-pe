# Multi branch disentangling for pose estimation

## Presentation

This is a work in progress so you might want to check it out later

## Architecture

$E_p$ pose encoder:
$E_a$ appearance encoder (ResNet18):
$D$ decoder:

There will be a nice picture here at some point

## Acknowledgements

The pose estimation encoder ($E_p$) is built on the work of [Diogo Luvizon](https://github.com/dluvizon/deephar) from the paper:
